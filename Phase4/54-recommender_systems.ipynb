    "Suppose we start with a matrix $R$ of users and products, where each cell records the ranking the relevant user gave to the relevant product. Very often we'll be able to record this data as a sparse matrix, because many users will not have ranked many items.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine factoring this matrix into a user matrix $P$ and an item matrix $Q^T$: $R = PQ^T$. What would the shapes of $P$ and $Q^T$ be? Clearly $P$ must have as many rows as $R$, which is just the number of users who have given ratings. Similarly, $Q^T$ must have as many columns as $R$, which is just the number of items that have received ratings. We also know that the number of columns of $P$ must match the number of rows of $Q^T$ for the factorization to be possible, but this number could really be anything. In practice this will be a small number, and for reasons that will emerge shortly let's refer to these dimensions as **latent features** of the items in $R$. If $p$ is a row of $P$, i.e. a user-vector, and $q$ is a column of $Q^T$, i.e. an item-vector, then $p$ will record the user's particular weights or *preferences* with respect to the latent features, while $q$ will record how the item ranks with respect to those same latent features. This in turn means that we could predict a user's ranking of a particular item simply by calculating the dot-product of $p$ and $q$! \n",
    "\n",
    "If we could effect such a factorization, $R = PQ^T$, then we could calculate *all* predictions, i.e. fill in the gaps in $R$, by solving for $P$ and $Q$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The isolation of these latent features can be achieved in various ways. But this is at heart a matter of **dimensionality reduction**, and so one way is with the [SVD](https://hackernoon.com/introduction-to-recommender-system-part-1-collaborative-filtering-singular-value-decomposition-44c9659c5e75).\n",

Even if i’ve \\[sic\\] viewed hundreds of items they might just express a couple of different tastes. Here we can actually use matrix factorization to mathematically reduce the dimensionality of our original 'all users by all items' matrix into something much smaller that represents 'all items by some taste dimensions' and 'all users by some taste dimensions'. These dimensions are called ***latent or hidden features*** and we learn them from our data\" ([Medium article: \"ALS Implicit Collaborative Filtering\"](https://medium.com/radon-dev/als-implicit-collaborative-filtering-5ed653ba39fe))."
